A Go language version of Wordle.

## Running

## Notes

 - I use Red/Amber/Green rather than Gray/Gold/Green.
 - I'm still not happy with the word list I created [dict.txt](./data/dict.txt). Using a dictionary API I removed 
proper names, and place names but more to do. Looking at past Wordle words though don't completely like their curation either.
